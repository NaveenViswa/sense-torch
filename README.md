# sense-torch
World first automatic environment light sensing torch mobile application.

How does it work ?

When we are in dark room, launch Sense Torch, It automatically  sensing the environmental light and instantly starts the flash light ON.
My app works in services, So we can move to other app (multi-tasking) is possible.
App will terminated when we press back button in mobile.
During phone call it temporally terminated then after phone call, It automatically start the app.
